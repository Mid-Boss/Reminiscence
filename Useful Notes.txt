This document is just a place to keep some useful notes about the game.

---------------
Video Info

Screen Size (for .ogv animations and such): 640 x 480
Steps to make videos:
  1) Create a video in a program of your choice
  2) Export as .mp4
  3) Convert to .ogv using the following site:
     http://video.online-convert.com/convert-to-ogg

     If necessary, change the frame size when you convert it on the website
     (note that the above website struggles with .avi files)
---------------
Custom Sprites (VE Side Battle Script)

-Files are referenced at beginning of script as stings (ex. 'filename')

-File names themselves must have [anim] appended as part of the name (ex.
 filename[anim].png)

-Use {mode: :sprite} or {mode: :charset} -> charset uses the standard 4x3
 character set, sprite allows for custom dimensions


-See VE_ACTION_SETTINGS[:robo] = "
 for an example of a custom action set
