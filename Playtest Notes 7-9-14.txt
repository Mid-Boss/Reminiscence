Playtest notes 7-9-14

-Noticed some weird lag at opening scene when map scrolled

-At Tak lvl 1, plants only do 3 damage

-Book burning scene froze when bad guy was supposed to move; most likely due to anti-lag script

-Slimes do 0 damage to lvl 2 Tak

-Stupid Rat does 0 damage to lvl 2 Tak

-Hornet does 0 damage to lvl 2 Tak

-Batzoo only does 3 damage to lvl 2 Tak

-Batzoo only does 1 damage to lvl 3 Tak

-Batzoo does 0 damage to lvl 4 Tak

-Angry Batzoo only does 6 damage to lvl 3 Tak

-Skal pile in the mine needs sound effects

-Tritops did 18 to lvl 4 Tak (not bad actually)

-Exited mine at Tak lvl 4

-Unwanted space in dialogue after getting laundry:
 "  Now look here you old [...]" -Tak

-Unwanted space in dialogue at Vero's house:
"Hmph... listen to little blue Vero now.
    You aren't even 0.00001% of the man [...]" -Kormaw

-When Vero joins the party, you can see him behind Tak.  Need to make him transparent at the end of his move route.

-Spider did 0 damage to lvl 5 Tak

-Top right of Aaglon 2nd floor looks weird b/c floor is at very edge of map.  Could fix, but would have to move all of the transfer events in and out of 2nd floor :(

-Smuggler face when he says "Pleasure doing business" and "Choose quickly" is still the old turban face, not the new hooded face

-No one can equip the Murse (need to change armor type to "general armor")

-Transparent background is annoying when using potions during battle

-Exited Aaglon pass with Tak lvl 7, Vero lvl 7 (no one died in Aaglon)

-Potentially remove Tak's comments in Skaylon shops (where it shows his face and he talks to dog and/or kid)
