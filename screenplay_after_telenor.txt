Story Elements after Telenor

==============================================================================80
Tent Scene
==============================================================================80

01. Player is instructed to return through underwater passage to get boat

02. Player takes boat North to bounty hunter tent

03. Upon entering the tent, the player finds that the woman from Skaylon is in
    the middle of a conversation with the bounty hunters.  She is being accused
    of committing some sort of crime, and the bounty hunters are going to arrest
    her.

04. The woman recognizes (or doesn't) Vero.  Either way she is attracted to him
    and flirts.

05. The bounty hunters assume that the woman is friends with the party and that
    they are accomplices in the accused crime.

06. The bounty hunters surround the party and the woman.  The screen goes black
    as fighting sounds are heard.

    \n<Vero>\n[001], help!

    \n<\n[001]>Vero!

07. (optional) Play the transfer sound.  Then:
    \n<Bounty Hunter #1>Hey boss, we got 'em!

    \n<???>Hmph!\.\. I knew those pansy shits didn't have it in them.  Is that
    Telenor's boat outside?  He must have tricked them into coming here.

    \n<Bounty Hunter #1>These two were working with Miss Blabeebloo in that
    job she tried to pull out East! They practically admitted it!

    \n<???>Is that so? Maybe I underestimated them after all, or at least Vero.

    \n<Bounty Hunter #1>Well what do you want us to do with them now?

    \n<???>You work for me, remember? I paid you to get them out of Yaava,
    not to ask me questions about how to do your fuckin' job.  I don't give a
    damn what you do with them, just as long as they're not here.

    \n<Bounty Hunter #1>You got it boss! My apologies!

Wake up in Dungeon
==============================================================================80

01. The screen is black and no music is playing

02. \n<\n[001]>.\..\..\..\..Ugh...

03. The screen fades in and Tak is facedown in a dungeon cell (there's a sprite
    for this)

04. \n<\n[001]>Where am I?

05. Tak gets up and walks to the door of his cell.  The map pans around the
    room, and the player sees Vero and another man in two different cells.

06. \n<\n[001]>Vero? Are you there?

    \n<Vero>Yeah I'm here...\. unfortunately. Do you know where we are?

07. The stranger man walks to the door of his cell:
    \n<Man>Hey you two finally woke up!  They must've hit you pretty hard, huh?

08. \n<Vero>Yes, well anyway \n[001] these cell doors look pretty strong and I
    don't think I have the proper magic skill to break them down.  Maybe if you
    weren't so worthless and you could, you know, USE FUCKING MAGIC we might
    have a shot of getting out of here.

    \n<Man>Calm down there friend! No one's getting out of here, magic or not.
    This is Slevenel, the old execution holding grounds of the king of Kreole.

    \n<\n[001]>Execution!? Vero we \fireallly\fi need to get out of here! We
    have to at least try.  Ready? \.\. On the count of three.

    1\..   2\..

    \n<Vero>3!

09. Tak runs into his door a bunch of times (he doesn't have a sword because
    they took his stuff, obviously).  Vero throws chairs at his door but
    nothing happens.

10. A guard runs into the room:
    \n<Guard>Hey you two! Stop making noise!

    \n<Vero>We'll stop making noise when you let us out of here!

    \n<Guard>Ok smart ass, we'll play by your rules.

11. The guard walks over to Vero's cell and opens the door.  He walks into the
    cell and hits vero with a sword, sending him flying into the back wall of
    the cell.

    \n<Guard>That oughta teach you to pipe down.

12. The screen fades to black and the music fades out.

13. After a brief pause, the music and screen fade back in and it says "Two 
    days later" at the top of the screen.

14. \n<\n[001]>Ten-thousand four hundred and sixty-four...
    Ten-thousand four hundred and sixty-five...
    Ten-thousand four hundred and sixty-six...
    Ten-thousand four hundred and sixty-seven...

    \n<Man>My turn!
    Ten-thousand four hundred and sixty-eight...
    Ten-thousand four hundred and sixty-nine...
    Ten-thousand four hundred and seventy!

    \n<Vero>Will you two stop that!

15. The screen fades to black and music fades out.

16. After a brief pause, the music and screen fade back in and it says
    "Later that day" at the top of the screen.

17. \n<Man>...And so that's when I knew that I was going to make her my wife.
    After a dog and two kids later, I can say it's the best decision I ever
    made.

    \n<\n[001]>Wow, good for you guys.  I wish I had someone like that in
    my life.

    \n<Vero>So tell us, Ramos, if you're such a good guy how did you end
    up here in Slevenel?

    \n<Ramos>That's a good question.  The thing is, nobody knows how they
    get here.  For the past month or so people have just been disappearing
    from my hometown of Kreole.  An old neighbor of mine was held in your
    cell, \n[001], but a few days before you showed up they took him away.
    Neither him nor I remember how we got here.  We both just remember going
    to sleep and waking up here.

    \n<\n[001]>Vero and I know how we got here! We were falsly accused of
    a crime, and then a band of bounty hunters brought us here!

    \n<Ramos>Are you sure about that? Maybe you were attacked by bounty
    hunters, but do you actually remember them bringing you here? They
    could be captives themselves! I have a suspicion that there's something
    more sinister at work.

    \n<Vero>Hmm an interesting theory. But what about these people just
    disappearing from Kreole? That seems awfully strange.

    \n<Ramos>Well the town security hasn't been very good since we were
    attacked.

    \n<\n[001]>Attacked? By who?

    \n<Ramos>No one really knows. The only accounts describe a shadowy figure
    appear at the edge of town right before it was destroyed by magic.
    Some of us managed to survive, and without anywhere else to go we stayed
    behind to rebuild.  We were making some progress until people started
    to vanish.

    \n<\n[001]>That's terrible. We need to get out of here and figure out
    what's going on.

    \n<Ramos>Unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen. I just hope
    I get to see my wife and kids one more time before it's all over...

18. The screen fades to black and music fades out.

19. After a brief pause, the music and screen fade back in and it says
    "The next day" at the top of the screen.

20. \n<\n[001]>One-million two hundred thirty thousand six hundred fifty-four...
    One-million two hundred thirty thousand six hundred fifty-five...
    
    \n<Man>One-million two hundred thirty thousand six hundred fifty-six...
    One-million two hundred thirty thousand six hundred fifty-seven...

    \n<Vero>Please stop.  Please stop.  Please stop.
    Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop!
    You are driving me crazy!

    \n<\n[001]>One-million two hundred thirty thousand six hundred fifty-eight...
    One-million two hundred thirty thousand six hundred fifty-nine...

    \n<Vero>Guards! Just kill me now! Hey! Guards!

21. At this point there are some fighting noises followed by a "umph!" noise.
    Miss Blabeebloo walks in.  She's taken out the guards!

    \n<Blabeebloo>Hello boys! What do you say? Want to get out of here?

22. Miss Blabeebloo walks over to each person's door and let's them out.

    \n<Blabeebloo>I got the keys from the guard outside.

*Need to actually write this part, but basically the guards aren't there
    because the woman distracted them or took them out or something.  At
    this point she walks into the room and opens everyone's cells.
